    "1. **Compiler errors:** All code you submit must compile. Programs that do not compile will probably receive an automatic zero. If you are having trouble getting your assignment to compile, please visit consulting hours. If you run out of time, it is better to comment out the parts that do not compile, than hand in a more complete file that does not compile.\n",
    "2. **Late assignments:** Please carefully review the course website's policy on late assignments, as all assignments handed in after the deadline will be considered late. Verify on moodle that you have submitted the correct version, before the deadline. Submitting the incorrect version before the deadline and realizing that you have done so after the deadline will be counted as a late submission."
